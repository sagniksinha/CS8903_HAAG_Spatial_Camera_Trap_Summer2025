# 🐾 Project HAAG Spatial Cameratrap
# HAAG OMSCS Summer 2025

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to **HAAG Spatial Cameratrap**. This repository contains everything you need to know about the project, along with links to important resources and contributors.

## ✍️ Project Description
The team is investigating how **spatial scaling and averaging** influence the apparent composition of wildlife communities captured through camera trap data.

## 🎯 Goals
- 📥 Download and clean **SnapShot USA** data
- 📊 Compile species that comprise individual “communities” by:
  - Using single-site data in **1-year** and **multi-year** intervals
  - Spatially clustering cameras within **50 km** and aggregating data across all years
- 🔍 Compare the **compositions of these communities**
- 🌍 *(Stretch goal)* Compare communities from camera trap data with communities derived from **IUCN range maps**

## 🧪 Experiments and code description
- Data cleaning
- Defining community and clustering: We have tried multiple clustering approach. Our final approach was Agglomerative clustering
- Application of jaccard index: Species movement and multi-year comparison
